# Privacy Policy — Homebase

Effective date: 2026-01-28

## Summary
Homebase does not sell personal data. It does not include analytics or tracking.
Most data stays on your device. Some features make network requests to fetch
content (news feeds, weather, and wallpaper media).

## Data the extension stores locally
Homebase stores the following locally in your browser (via browser storage and/or localStorage):
- Your settings (enabled widgets, preferences, UI configuration)
- Cached content for faster loading (e.g., recently fetched news items)
- Wallpaper selections and cached wallpaper assets
- Cached media files (images and videos) stored locally to support wallpapers and fast loading


## Browsing data access (bookmarks/history/tabs/containers)
If you enable related features, Homebase may access:
- Bookmarks (to display and manage your bookmark grid)
- History (to show recent items and improve suggestions, if enabled)
- Tabs (to open links in new tabs / manage opening behavior)
- Firefox Containers (to open items in a specific container, if enabled)

Homebase does not transmit your bookmarks or history contents to a server.

## Clipboard access
Homebase reads clipboard text only when you explicitly trigger a paste action
(e.g., “Paste URL to Save” or a keyboard shortcut you use for pasting).
Clipboard contents are used locally to create a bookmark you requested.
Clipboard contents are not uploaded or transmitted by Homebase.
Clipboard contents are not stored, logged, or retained after the requested action completes.

## Analytics and tracking
Homebase does not include analytics, telemetry, tracking pixels, or user profiling.

## Network requests (content downloads)
Homebase makes network requests only to provide enabled features:

### Wallpaper media (videos/images)
Homebase downloads wallpaper content and a remote manifest from:
- [Wallpaper CDN](https://pub-552ebdc4e1414c8594cec0ac58404459.r2.dev/) (manifest + media)

This remote content is used only as wallpaper media and metadata. Homebase does not download or execute remote code.

### Favicons
Homebase fetches website icons (favicons) for your bookmarks and history items using
public icon services provided by Google (www.google.com and t2.gstatic.com).
This occurs only when a local icon is not found.

### News feeds (RSS)
When the News widget is enabled, Homebase fetches RSS feeds from the selected source,
such as Al Jazeera, BBC RSS, Feedburner feeds, ESPN, and Cricinfo feeds.

### Weather
When the Weather widget is enabled, Homebase fetches weather and geocoding data
from Open-Meteo endpoints.

### Search suggestions
If search suggestions are enabled, Homebase requests suggestions from your selected provider
(Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or Yandex) as you type.

## What servers may receive
Like any web request, the servers you contact may receive standard network information,
such as your IP address, user agent, and request metadata. This is controlled by the server operators’ own logging policies.

## Backup and restore (local only)
Homebase includes optional local backup and restore features that allow you to export and re-import your settings and data manually.

Backups are created locally by the browser at your request and are saved as files on your device. Homebase does not upload backups, does not provide cloud sync, and does not require accounts or login.

## Data deletion
You can remove Homebase data at any time by:
- removing the extension, and/or
- clearing extension/site data in your browser settings.
