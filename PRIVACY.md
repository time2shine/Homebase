# Privacy Policy — Homebase

Effective date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary
Homebase does not sell personal data. It does not include analytics or tracking.
Most data stays on your device. Some features make network requests to fetch
content (news feeds, weather, and wallpaper media).

## Data the extension stores locally
Homebase stores the following locally in your browser (via browser storage and/or localStorage):
- Your settings (enabled widgets, preferences, UI configuration)
- Cached content for faster loading (e.g., recently fetched news items)
- Wallpaper selections and cached wallpaper assets

## Browsing data access (bookmarks/history/tabs/containers)
If you enable related features, Homebase may access:
- Bookmarks (to display and manage your bookmark grid)
- History (to show recent items and improve suggestions, if enabled)
- Tabs (to open links in new tabs / manage opening behavior)
- Firefox Containers (to open items in a specific container, if enabled)

Homebase does not transmit your bookmarks or history contents to a server.

## Clipboard access
Homebase reads clipboard text only when you explicitly trigger a paste action
(e.g., “Paste URL to Save” or a keyboard shortcut you use for pasting).
Clipboard contents are used locally to create a bookmark you requested.
Clipboard contents are not uploaded or transmitted by Homebase.

## Network requests (content downloads)
Homebase makes network requests only to provide enabled features:

### Wallpaper media (videos/images)
Homebase downloads wallpaper content and a remote manifest from:
- https://pub-552ebdc4e1414c8594cec0ac58404459.r2.dev/ (manifest + media) 

This remote content is used only as wallpaper media and metadata. Homebase does
not download or execute remote code.

### News feeds (RSS)
When the News widget is enabled, Homebase fetches RSS feeds from the selected source,
such as Al Jazeera, BBC RSS, Feedburner feeds, ESPN, and Cricinfo feeds.

### Weather
When the Weather widget is enabled, Homebase fetches weather and geocoding data
from Open-Meteo endpoints.

### Search suggestions
If search suggestions are enabled, Homebase may request suggestion results from the
configured provider(s).

## What servers may receive
Like any web request, the servers you contact may receive standard network information,
such as your IP address, user agent, and request metadata. This is controlled by the
server operators’ own logging policies.

## Sync accounts (future feature)
If Homebase adds sync, this policy will be updated to clearly describe:
- what data is synced,
- where it is stored,
- how you can delete synced data/account,
- and whether any third-party services are involved.

## Data deletion
You can remove Homebase data at any time by:
- removing the extension, and/or
- clearing extension/site data in your browser settings.

## Contact
If you publish publicly, add a contact email here: your-email@example.com
