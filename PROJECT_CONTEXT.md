# Homebase — Project Context & Repository Knowledge Base

**Project:** Homebase (Dual-Browser Manifest V3 Dashboard Extension)  
**Current Stable Release:** `v0.17.0` (October 9, 2026)  
**Active Development Cycle:** Cycle #13 (Monolith Deconstruction & Core Startup Architecture)  
**Repository:** [https://github.com/time2shine/Homebase](https://github.com/time2shine/Homebase)

## 1. Mission & Vision

Homebase is designed to replace the browser's default new-tab page with a lightning-fast, highly customizable, and distraction-free productivity environment. 

Core value propositions:
1. **Instant First Paint**: Synchronous head execution via `preload.js` applies cached wallpaper posters, theme colors, and layout configurations before DOM rendering begins, achieving perceived zero-latency boot.
2. **First-Class Bookmark Organization**: Virtualized tile grids, nested folder navigation, smooth drag-and-drop reordering, folder tab rows, and context-menu controls built on top of native browser bookmark stores.
3. **Comprehensive Customization**: Dynamic accent extraction from wallpaper artwork, video background playback with caching, customizable glassmorphism filters, material color palettes, and configurable sidebar widgets.
4. **Privacy & Local Ownership**: Zero third-party telemetry, no cloud accounts, transactional offline settings backups, and local-first storage.

## 2. Platform Architecture & Dual-Browser Target

Homebase is engineered as a universal browser extension supporting both Chromium and Gecko engines from a unified codebase:

| Platform | Manifest Target | Target Stores | Key Characteristics |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Google Chrome / Chromium** | [`manifests/manifest.chrome.json`](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/Homebase/manifests/manifest.chrome.json) | Chrome Web Store, Edge Addons | Manifest V3, `chrome_url_overrides.newtab`, standard extension permissions. |
| **Mozilla Firefox** | [`manifests/manifest.firefox.json`](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/Homebase/manifests/manifest.firefox.json) | Firefox Add-ons (AMO) | Manifest V3, Gecko ID (`rokonmagura@gmail.com`), `strict_min_version: 142.0`, `contextualIdentities` permission for container tabs. |

The build system (`scripts/build.mjs`) builds both targets simultaneously into `dist/chrome/` and `dist/firefox/` by combining `src/` assets with target-specific manifests.

## 4. Key Subsystems & Canonical Owners

Homebase enforces a **single canonical owner** rule for every subsystem:

1. **Bookmark Drag Controller (`HomebaseBookmarkDragController`)**:
   - Location: `src/newtab/bookmarks/bookmark-drag-controller.js`
   - Responsibilities: Grid & folder tab SortableJS instances, pointer raycasting, folder hover locking, tile reordering, and WebExtension move dispatches.
2. **Bookmark Grid Controller (`HomebaseBookmarkGridController`)**:
   - Location: `src/newtab/bookmarks/bookmark-grid-controller.js`
   - Responsibilities: Virtualized tile grid layout, DOM rendering, row calculations, and grid event delegation.
3. **Bookmark Loader Service (`HomebaseBookmarkLoader`)**:
   - Location: `src/newtab/bookmarks/bookmark-loader-service.js`
   - Responsibilities: Recursive bookmark tree fetching, root display ID determination, and folder metadata loading.
4. **Storage Facade (`HomebaseStorage`)**:
   - Location: `src/newtab/core/storage-service.js`
   - Responsibilities: Unified storage access across Chrome & Firefox, batch writes (`setMany`), schema versioning, and cache invalidation.
5. **Storage Dispatcher (`HomebaseStorageDispatcher`)**:
   - Location: `src/newtab/core/storage-dispatcher.js`
   - Responsibilities: Decoupled pub/sub event pipeline notifying components of storage updates without tight coupling.
6. **Wallpaper Controller (`HomebaseWallpaperController`)**:
   - Location: `src/newtab/wallpaper/wallpaper-controller.js`
   - Responsibilities: Background video playback, poster caching, daily rotation timing, and gallery hydration.

## 5. Execution Model & Performance Invariants

### 5.1 Two-Phase Startup Flow
1. **Critical Phase (Instant & Synchronous)**:
   - `preload.js` runs in `<head>` before any DOM element exists, reading fast storage mirrors from `localStorage` to immediately apply wallpaper posters and themes.
   - `instant_load.js` renders cached bookmark tabs and layout skeletons.
   - Page enters `ready` state within milliseconds (`body.classList.add('ready')`).
2. **Non-Critical Phase (Deferred Idle Hydration)**:
   - Heavy dashboard widgets (weather network fetching, news RSS parser, quote catalog building, todo lists, search engines) are deferred into cooperative idle slices using `requestIdleCallback` (`scheduleIdleTask`).
   - The user experiences zero UI jank or input freezing during initial tab opening.

### 5.2 Script Loading Contract
- All scripts load via classic `<script defer>` tags in `src/new-tab.html`.
- No bundler is used; modules run directly in browser engines.
- Scripts evaluate sequentially in document order within a shared global execution context.
- Top-level variables must be unique across all scripts to prevent `SyntaxError` declaration collisions.

## 6. Collaboration Standards & AI Workflow

All engineering activities follow the strict 7-step lifecycle:
$$\text{Audit} \longrightarrow \text{Plan} \longrightarrow \text{Wait for Approval} \longrightarrow \text{Implement} \longrightarrow \text{Verify} \longrightarrow \text{Commit} \longrightarrow \text{Push}$$

Protected files (`src/preload.js`, `src/instant_load.js`, `manifests/*`, `dist/*`) remain untouched unless authorized. All changes must be verified against the 4-stage test pipeline before committing.
